> [!NOTE]
> By providing comprehensive documentation, well-defined tests, and an exact audit scope, your team will significantly expedite the auditing process. This ensures that we can begin our work without delays caused by missing or unclear information. While some checklist items may not be applicable to your project, filling in as much of the checklist as possible is highly encouraged, as it helps us better understand your system and saves valuable time for both teams. Clear and thorough submissions reduce the need for follow-ups, allowing the audit to progress more efficiently.
